WhatIsUnique - A World of Warcraft AddOn
===================================

WhatIsUnique adds a line to item tooltips when it finds an item which has a unique model. This currently only supports weapons.

Installation
------------

All Stable Releases of WhatIsUnique are automagically packaged on [Curse](http://curse.com) and available through the [Curse Client](http://www.curse.com/client/). The addon can be downloaded from the [WhatIsUnique Project Page](http://wow.curse.com/downloads/wow-addons/details/whatisunique.aspx) using the manual function or the client buttons.

Development
-----------

If you are interested in contributing to the addon or just want to check out the code feel free to check out the [WhatIsUnique Source Code](https://github.com/Fluxflashor/WhatIsUnique) on Github.

Issues and Feature Requests
---------------------------

I ask that all problems with the addon are reported to the [WhatIsUnique Issue Tracker](https://github.com/Fluxflashor/WhatIsUnique/issues) on Github. Checking the Curse project page can be a bit of a pain in the ass sometimes and it helps me if I can keep everything organized in one place.

Thanks for checking it out and I hope someone else can make use of this addon!
